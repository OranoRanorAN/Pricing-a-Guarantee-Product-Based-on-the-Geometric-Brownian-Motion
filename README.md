# Pricing-a-Guarantee-Product-Based-on-the-Geometric-Brownian-Motion

- Modelled the stock index of the product with a Geometric Brownian motion (GBM)
- Performed Monte Carlo simulation to simulate the stock index and the corresponding path of return
- Calculated the present value of the expected payoff as the price of the product
